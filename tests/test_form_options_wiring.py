"""The CALL SITES actually use form_options — not just that the module works.

`tests/test_form_options.py` exercises the builders in isolation, which leaves the
wiring unpinned: flipping `drop_dated` in `bsn.py::mapping()`, or dropping
`packaging_options` from the render context, keeps every one of those tests green.
The pre-existing `test_mapping_category_picker.py` only asserts the option-group
KEYS are present (`'conditions:' in html`) — a substring check that cannot see a
wrong VALUE.

So each test here compares what a page RENDERS against what `form_options` says it
should, and FORCES the DB state it depends on (a dated condition must exist) rather
than inheriting whatever the cloned dev DB happens to hold — `tmp_db` copies the
live DB with its data.
